# SPPU-SE-CGL
## Assingment list


1. Install and explore the OpenGL
   
2. Implement DDA and Bresenham line drawing algorithm to draw: i) Simple Line ii) Dotted Line 
iii) Dashed Line iv) Solid line ;using mouse interface Divide the screen in four quadrants with 
center as (0, 0). The line should work for all the slopes positive as well as negative.

3. Implement Bresenham circle drawing algorithm to draw any object. The object should be 
displayed in all the quadrants with respect to center and radius- C02

4. Implement the following polygon filling methods : i) Flood fill / Seed fill ii) Boundary fill ; using 
mouse click, keyboard interface and menu driven programming

5. Implement Cohen Sutherland polygon clipping method to clip the polygon with respect the 
viewport and window. Use mouse click, keyboard interface
